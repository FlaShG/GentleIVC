 Our story begins (as it quite often is)
 in a far-away land, where a young little Miss
 with Alice her name lived a worriless life.
 The daughter of a [! 4-silben-beruf] and his wife,
 her days seemed to her rather boring and dull
 - that is, until one day, while watching a gull,
 she thought [quietly]: if I only could fly!
 I'd dance with the clouds [gaaay] and be queen of the sky,
 make loopings, and spirals, nose up and reverse,
 no longer then bound to this tedious earth.
 
 A word and a blow, a clever young girl,
 she started to gather and, after that, hurl
 all kinds of things which one can make blow up
 right into the chimney, and also a cup
 of her father's moonshine, // -- blabla, feuer anzünden
 
 
 The explosion was [massive], which made her quite proud.
 It sent her straight air-borne, and she bursted out:
 I fly now! I fly! Oh, how great is this.
 And was quite excited, our young little Miss.
 
 Her pleasure, however, did not last for long.
 She realized quickly that earth has a strong
 attraction to those who are up in the air.
 She soon commenced falling - which she deemed not fair
 and fluttered her arms, with commotion, quite loud, // aah! garstig! überarbeiten
 but all did not help. She fell out ouf a cloud.
 
 // -- insert übergang hier
 
 When Alice got up [meh] from her frustrating [meh again] fall,
 she was in a place she did not know at all!
 She looked [then? another meh] around and, oh dear, what she found!
 She stood on a 'shroom in fullest of bloom
 so high, she could not see the ground.
 
 Our young lady, though, still was far from despair. [meh]
 She seeked a way down [meeh], when out of the air
 two eyes and two ears and four feet and a tail
 and a smirk which seemed slightly to be out of scale [meh once more]
 
 // -- inser übergangsverse hier
 
 It seemed like a cat
 - and a strange one of that! -
 just shadow and smoke and a grin.
 
 
  // -- ab hier noch baustelle 
 She said, feeling quite in distress:
 "My dear Mister cat, this I must confess:
 I can't seem to find
 my way - be so kind
 and help me get out of this mess."
 
 But the cat with the smile remained mute.
 So Alice decided to slide down to the root
 of the mushroom on whose top she'd ended her fall.
 She strode through the forest, surrounded by tall
 
 
 curious beast
 , still not saying the least
 
 
 
 
 
 But - ah! - I'm a terrible host.
 Come in, be my guest,   //
 Come in, get some rest, // meh
 Come in now!, said he,
 Come in, have some tea!
 And biscuits, and buttered toast.
 
 Our Alice was rather confused. Dear Sir, answered she,
 I don't see any house. I would sure like some tea,
 but what of the pot? What cups have you got?
 And where are the chairs? And what about stairs?
 
 
 And he threw it high in the air.
 When it hit the ground, she was no longer there.
 
 
 
 
 Sir Povington answered her plead:
 "Of course I will help with your need!
 We'll find your way out
 - of that have no doubt!
 You will get back home. Yes, indeed!"
 
 
 
 But never forget
 the man with the mustache and hat.
